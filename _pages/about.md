Hi, I'm **Diego Marcilio**.

I'm a software engineer at [Uber's Programming Systems Group](https://www.uber.com/nl/en/about/science/), where I develop program analysis and refactoring tools to increase developers' productivity and improve code quality.

I'm interested in all things related to source code, including mining repositories, program transformations, and code review. Before Uber, I got a PhD in 2023 from [USI](https://www.si.usi.ch/) in Switzerland, advised by [Prof. Carlo A. Furia](https://bugcounting.net).

Please leave me a note at dvmarcilio [at] gmail [dot] com
