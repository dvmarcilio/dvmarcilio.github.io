Hi, I'm **Diego Marcilio**.

From October 2019, I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Software Institute](https://www.si.usi.ch/) of [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.inf.usi.ch) at the [Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI)](https://www.usi.ch), in Switzerland. I am currently working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Carlo A. Furia](https://bugcounting.net/).

In August 2019, I earned my master degree from [the University of Brasília (UnB)](https://unb.br/), in Brazil, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Rodrigo Bonifácio](https://wp.rbonifacio.net/). During that time, I also had the privilege of working along with [Prof. Dr. Gustavo Pinto](http://gustavopinto.org/) in some publications.

I come from an industry background, in which I acquired seven years of experience working as a Software Engineer, mainly with Web Development, in diverse companies in Brasília, Brazil.

My research interests are motivated by my industry experience and thus center around _aiding developers_ when _understanding, writing, and maintaining source code_.

So far, I've investigated which kind of static analysis tools violations Java developers fix ([ICPC 2019](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icpc2019.pdf)), and proposed a tool to automatically fix a subset of useful violations  ([SCAM 2019](https://bugcounting.net/pubs/scam19.pdf)), which fixes were welcomed by established open-source projects.
